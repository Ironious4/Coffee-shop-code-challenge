# Topic:Code challenge


# Setting up the enviroment
Set up the coding environment through these steps:
 1. Create a remote github repository for the assignment.
 2. Create a local repository for the assignment.(mkdir folder name)
 3. Create the file for working on the questions.(touch file.txt)
 4. Get started on the assignment.


# Structure
The structure of this directory is as follows:
1. lib which contains the files for all codes
2. Pipfile
3. Pipfile.lock
4. README.md


# What to do
In this code challenge, you are working on a Coffee shop-style domain containing 3 models.The models include Coffee,Customer and Order.The Coffee has many Orders,a Customer has many Orders and an Order belongs to a Customer and to a Coffee.




# Running the codes
The codes should be run through the terminal to ensure that they are working.To do this simply use the command 'nodemon --exec python main.py' to get the output of the codes in the terminal. For any errors encounted, the terminal will give clues as to how to solve them. 


# Submitting work done
After finishing the code challenge, the following should be done:
1. Save your changes
2. Link your local repository with your remote repository(git remote add origin).
3. Add your files(git add .)
4. Commit your changes(git commit -m "message")
5. Push your changes to the remote repository(git push origin branch name)

After finishing these steps you should see your updated changes in your github profile.
 
Before we forget,the work is to be submitted to canvas. Simply paste the URL of the work in the submission section of the code challenge and click on submit assignment.

That's pretty much it! The code challenge has been successfully completed and submitted!
